    <h1>👨‍💻 Founder’s Journey</h1><div class="highlight">
  <p>
    The story of <strong>MentorMindz</strong> starts not with a tech expert or a millionaire — but with a boy who once scored <strong>0 marks</strong>. From Class 4 to 9, I was a below-average student. Sometimes I got marks like 1 or 0. No one believed I would become a tech innovator — not even me.
  </p>
  <p>
    But everything started to change in Class 10 and 11. I became an average student — and then, in Class 11, I became the <strong>topper in Computer Science</strong>. That subject unlocked a new mindset: a coder’s mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    I set a goal to get 100/100 in every subject. Though I reached 99, the fire inside had already started. I built my own SQL-like language in Python called <code>sqlbase</code>. I also created games like Rock Paper Scissors, Raja Rani Game, Foot or Bat — all coded in Python. My classmates played them. My teacher appreciated me. My confidence grew.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then in Class 12, my interest expanded into Physics and Chemistry. I even topped in Physics once. I stayed top in Computer Science always — in every exam, including the board exam. I scored <strong>99 out of 100</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But my journey wasn’t just academic. I had also lived the mindset of failure, struggle, and average. I understood how different students think. I helped teach my friends, so I knew the teacher’s mindset. I coded tools and websites — the developer mindset.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 The Spark of MentorMindz</h2>
  <p>
    In 2024, around August, I saw students paying ₹30,000–50,000 for online coaching. What about those who can’t? I asked myself: Why isn’t there a 24/7 <strong>AI teacher</strong> that can mentor students personally — anytime, anywhere, affordably?
  </p>
  <p>
    That question gave birth to <strong>MentorMindz AI</strong>. A platform where every learner has a mentor. Built not by a company — but by a student for students.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started the journey officially on <strong>April 6, 2025</strong>, just after my board exams. It wasn’t easy. I struggled between studies and my startup. But passion pushed me forward.
  </p>

  <h2>📚 From WhatsApp to Web Dev</h2>
  <p>
    Back in Class 5 and 6, I didn’t even know how to use WhatsApp. My classmates sent GIFs and messages. I watched. But now, I can build my own messaging app if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I self-learned programming from YouTube. My first language was Python. Then I explored C++, HTML, CSS — and slowly built confidence. I created my first website: <strong>rspnodes</strong> — a homework management tool for my own class. It listed topics and helped absent students catch up.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first day, my teacher appreciated it. But then, students ignored it. That taught me a valuable lesson: Build for real use, not just appreciation.
  </p>

  <h2>💡 The Mission Today</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve walked the path of a struggler, an average kid, a topper, a mentor, and now, a founder. MentorMindz is not just an app. It’s my story — and the future story of every student who dares to dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I can go from 0 to 99 — so can anyone. If I can learn to teach others — anyone can become a mentor. If I can build from nothing — so can you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Welcome to the world of <strong>AI-powered learning</strong>, driven by empathy, experience, and excellence.
